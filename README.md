Title: pokerspadegame

Introduction: This project aims to write unit tests for several functions related to a poker game based on only spades.

Technology Used: Pycharm(Python)

How to use: No user input is required for this project however it tests to see if the code in the main file will properly play the poker-spade games with the different functions like straight, 3 of a kind, and royal flush

Examples of use: To create an online poker-spade game

Issues: The only issue that was run into was a logical error. In the play_game function the variables that were meant to be 'right' were written as 'left'
